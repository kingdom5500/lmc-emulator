# This file is used for the opcode configuration.

# "x" is used to indicate a space for an argument
# or address. If an argument passed is too large
# to fit in the amount of digits you've assigned,
# an error will be raised. However, if the argument
# is too small, the assembler will pad the value.

# NOTE: According to Peter Higginson's version of
# this emulator, the "4xx" opcode range is unused.
# I may use this to implement extra opcodes that
# are not compatible with his implementation soon.
